**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals  of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator for linux os ([https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/58ae46bb_linux-sim/linux-sim.zip](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/58ae46bb_linux-sim/linux-sim.zip)) and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model_nvidia_6.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

Before I decided to settle for the final model I have tried two model architucture to extract feature. The first one is the LeNet which consitst of normalization layer, 2 convolution layers, 2 fully connected layers and the second one is the NVIDIA end to end model which consists of 9 layers, including a normalization layer, 5 convolutional layers, and 3 fully connected layers.Both models includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer and the LeNet model also includes the maxpooling layers.


#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 21). 

To protect over fitting of the model I have tried to impliment dropout  regularization after the first conolutional layer and the first fully connected layer. I also have tried the 'L2' regularization technique but both haven't imporved model performance.  When I included the regularization technique the model most of the times doesn't drerive well, The model has difficulties to stay longer on track during simulation. As the dropout method used probability to keep some of the data for trainning the CNN model, it might have left some critical data point sepecifically on the curve, that leads the simulation to steer off track when approaching curves. What helps more to better model performance is the standaerdization of the streering angle measuremet. 

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually.

#### 4. Appropriate training data

I have used the key board to collect the training data which was actually very challenging to get an accurate data, as the car sometimes go off track while collecting and difficult to drive smoothly on the track. For that I have to collect training data seveeral times until I believe that I have got appropraite dataset.  I have actaully collected training over half dozen of times. The final dataset I used for training contains dataset of about 6 laps, 2 lap driving center, one lap dring smoothly along curves, one lap recovery and  two laps reverse driving. This finally gets me to collect more than 15,000 datasets which helps train the model better. 


### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

As I explained above before I settle for the final model I have used two well know model in deep learning the LeNet and NVIDIA end-to-end models. For the final test I have collected 6 laps of data from diverse perspective, center, recover and reverse drive, which produces about more than 47k datasets in total before agumentation.  The two models employ convolution neural networks model with different architucture. Before training these models and decide which one to go with, I used data agumentation technique to get more data or information for training the model. After augmentation of data, the total dataset become more than 95k. The dataset(i.e images and steering angles) were split into training and validation sets. For both models the the mse for training set is less than that of the mse for validation sets. Howere it is only the NVIDIA end-to-end mode which was able to drive that car authonomous around the track successfully.  


#### 2. Final Model Architecture

Attempts was made to modify the NVIDIA model to perform better or to reduce overfitting or underfitting, however every time I introduce regularization technique such as droput or L2 the model prefoms worse,So I chose to not modify the original model architecture, and simple extract features from the model. The final model architucture is depicted in the figure below. The model consists of 9 layers, including a normalization layer, 5 convolutional layers, and 3 fully connected layers

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process
Before the gathering the final dataset for training, I have collectd training data by simply driving along the center track for 4 laps, 3 laps and even 6 laps, but these dataset fail to produce good dataset to appropraitly train the model to autonomously drive along the first track. The final dataset used for training the final model is collected from 2 center driving laps, 1 driving smoothly along the curve, 1 lap recover driving with out stopping recording as through the whole lap, and 2 lap reverse driving which yeild good training dataset. The figure below shows records from all cameras driving center of the track.

The total data set after agumentation was applied is 95496,The agumentation was made by filiping the image (figure below) and multipling the corrosponding streeting angle by -1. The figure below shows the histogram of the original data set and after the data set was standardized.

For model training the dataset was shuffled and split into 80% training data and 20 % validation data. Due to memory issue I only trained the model for 3 epochs. I tried to use the GPU in AWS however after training the model and copying it to my local machine the model didn't work to drive the car autonomously. So decided to use my laptop for training the model.
